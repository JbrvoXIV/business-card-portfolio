            <p>
            I am a current Computer Science student at Florida International University. 
            I graduated with an Associates in December of 2021 with a Bachelors expected for December of 2023. 
            I have decided to delve into the world of Web Development and further my skills and knowledge in this field. 
            I am highly self-motivated and hard-working with a love for all things code. 
            As I continue throughout my studies, I look forward to learning as much as I can about Web Development along with the many intricacies involved with the field.
